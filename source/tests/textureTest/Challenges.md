1. Generate your own nice texture data.
2. Change the filtering of the texture to be "nearest".
3. Change the texture coordinates in the vertexBuffer
4. Add another triangle so that you can see the entire texture.
5. Animate the texture coordinates in the shader by adding a new uniform.
6. See what happens if you change the wrap mode to "clamp"
7. use two textures
